I'm mainly referencing the Google C++ style guide found here : https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Naming

fileNames : Uppercase and dashes
classes, structs, types aliases, enums, and templates : all are pascal case
enum members : same as constants
functions : pascal case
functions (accessors) : camel case
variables : snake case
constants : leading k with camel case following
private class members: snake case with a trailing underscore
macros : caps lock snake case
