BlockGame is a minecraft clone which I'm building solo using Cpp, SFML, and OpenGL

While building this project, I mainly referenced [LearnOpenGL.com](https://learnopengl.com/), the [SFML tutorials](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/), [Victor Gordan](https://www.youtube.com/@VictorGordan), and [WSAL Evan](https://www.youtube.com/@wsalevan)
